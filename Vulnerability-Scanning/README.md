## üõ† Tools Used:
- Splunk Enterprise
- Windows Event Logs

## üéØ Objective:
- Monitor and analyze Windows Security Logs using Splunk Enterprise.
- Detect suspicious activities such as failed login attempts, account lockouts and malware detections.
- Build up a security dashboard for real-time monitoring.

## üìñ Steps Taken:
1. Installed and launched Splunk Enterprise on Windows.
2. Logged in to Splunk Web Interface: http://localhost:8000 using admin credentials created at installation.
3. Configured Windows Security Event Logs as a data source to collect and ingest Logs.
