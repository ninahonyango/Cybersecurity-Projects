## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Splunk Enterprise
- Windows Event Logs

## 🎯 Objective:
- Monitor and analyze Windows Security Logs using Splunk Enterprise.
- Detect suspicious activities such as failed login attempts, account lockouts and malware detections.
- Build up a security dashboard for real-time monitoring.

## 📖 Steps Taken:
1. Installed and launched Splunk Enterprise on Windows.
2. Logged in to Splunk Web Interface: http://localhost:8000 using admin credentials created at installation.
3. Configured Windows Security Event Logs as a data source to collect and ingest Logs.

     Settings > Data Inputs
     Add Windows Event Logs (WinEventLog://Security)
/*Once logs are ingested, create visualizations.*/
4. Created Splunk search using Splunk's (SPL) Search Processing Language to detect securitu events.
5. Designed a security monitoring dashboard to visualize threats.
6. Document Findings & Create a GitHub Repo

## 🚀 Key Takeaways:
- Wireshark is a powerful network analysis tool.
- Organizations must implement ARP security measures to prevent spoofing attacks in enterprise networks.
- ARP is a foundational protocol, but it lacks built-in security.
- Attackers can exploit ARP spoofing to perform on-path attacks.
- Implementing security measures like DAI, static ARP tables, and VLAN segmentation can protect networks.
