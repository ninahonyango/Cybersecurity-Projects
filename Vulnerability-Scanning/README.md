## üõ† Tools Used:
- Splunk Enterprise
- Windows Event Logs

## üéØ Objective:
- Monitor and analyze Windows Security Logs using Splunk Enterprise.
- Detect suspicious activities such as failed login attempts, account lockouts and malware detections.
- Build up a security dashboard for real-time monitoring.

## üìñ Steps Taken:
1. Installed and launched Splunk Enterprise on Windows.
2. Logged in to Splunk Web Interface: http://localhost:8000 using admin credentials created at installation.
3. Configured Windows Security Event Logs as a data source to collect and ingest Logs.

     Settings > Data Inputs
     Add Windows Event Logs (WinEventLog://Security)
     *Once logs are ingested, create visualizations.*

4. Created Splunk search using Splunk's (SPL) Search Processing Language to detect securitu events.
5. Designed a security monitoring dashboard to visualize threats.
6. Documented the findings.

*Used the Wildcard Search (**):

*This query retrieves all events within the specified time range (Last 24 hours).*
*It is not filtering logs based on specific fields, sources, or event types.*

*Refined the Search Query: Instead of retrieving all logs, filter for*
*security-related events like login failures or system warnings.*
